AMAZON PRODUCT PAGE USING REACT JS 💫
-
This project is a React JS based Amazon-style product listing page built as part of a learning activity.
The goal of this project is to understand core React concepts by building a real UI instead of isolated examples.

The application focuses on component-based architecture, reusable UI blocks, and dynamic data rendering using props.

PROJECT OVERVIEW ✨
-
The project replicates a simplified Amazon product card layout where multiple products are displayed with images, features, and pricing information.

Each product is rendered dynamically using reusable components and data passed through props.

TECHNOLOGIES USED 🔥
-
React JS
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
Vite

CORE REACT CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED ✅
-
JSX syntax
Functional components
Props usage
Passing arrays and objects as props
Rendering lists using map
Component structuring
Conditional rendering
Component-level styling
Reusable UI components

COMPONENT DESIGN APPROACH 😏
-
Each UI section is broken into reusable components.
The ProductCard component receives product details as props and renders them dynamically.

Pricing, headings, and layouts are handled as independent components to maintain separation of concerns.

LEARNING OUTCOMES 🥇
-
Improved understanding of React component flow
Clear understanding of props and data passing
Hands-on experience with rendering dynamic content
Better folder organization and project structuring
Confidence in building UI-focused React projects

PROJECT STATUS 💌
-
Completed as a learning activity
Future improvements may include responsiveness, hover effects, and interactivity
